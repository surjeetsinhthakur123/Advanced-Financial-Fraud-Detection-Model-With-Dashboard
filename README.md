## Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Model with Dashboard

## Overview

The Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Model with Dashboard is a robust fraud detection system that integrates machine learning techniques with a real-time dashboard. This project leverages Power BI for data visualization, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for fraud detection, and Flask for real-time analysis.

## Features

1. Machine Learning-Based Fraud Detection: Utilizes classification algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions.

2. Real-Time Analysis: Implements a Flask-based API to process transactions dynamically.

3. Power BI Dashboard: Provides interactive data visualizations for fraud trends and transaction patterns.

4. Scalable and Modular Design: Ensures flexibility for further enhancements and integrations.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: To create advanced calculations and performance metrics.
- **Power Query Editor**: For data transformation and cleaning.

## Getting Started

To explore the Fraud Detection project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Power BI Desktop (latest version)
- Python 3.x and required libraries
- Kaggle dataset (financial fraud data)

### Installation

1. **Download the Dataset**

   - Obtain the financial fraud dataset from Kaggle.
   
2. **Open Power BI Desktop**
   - Install it if you haven’t already.

3. **Load the Data**

   - Go to Home > Get Data > CSV (or respective format).
   - Select the dataset file and click Load.

4. **Transform and Clean Data**

   - Use Power Query Editor for data preparation:
     - Go to Home > Transform Data.
     - Apply necessary transformations.

5. **Train and Deploy the Model**

   - Use Scikit-learn and TensorFlow to train fraud detection models.
   - Deploy the Flask API for real-time predictions.

6. **Create KPIs and Dashboards**

   - Use DAX for custom metrics::
     - Go to Modeling > New Measure to define new metrics.
   - Design and arrange visualizations.

### Publish the Report

- To share your report with others, publish it to the Power BI service:
  1. Save your Power BI file.
  2. Go to **Home > Publish** in Power BI Desktop.
  3. Sign in with your Power BI account if prompted.
  4. Select a workspace in the Power BI service where you want to publish the report.
  5. Once published, access the report in the Power BI service to share it with stakeholders via a link or by embedding it in other platforms.

## Project Structure

- **Project Files/**: Contains all files related to the project, including the Power BI file and scripts.
- **fraud_detection.pbix**: The Power BI project file with data transformations, visualizations, and dashboards.
- **Data/**: Folder containing the fraud detection dataset and any supporting files.
- **Documentation/**: Includes project documentation, reports, and guides for usage.

## Usage

1. Open **fraud_detection.pbix** in Power BI Desktop.
2. Explore dashboards using filters and slicers.
3. Analyze fraud detection insights interactively.
4. Run the Flask API for real-time transaction analysis.
5. Share insights via Power BI service.
